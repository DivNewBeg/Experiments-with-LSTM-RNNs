The objective of this project is to run some experiments on RNNs and LSTMs to develop a deeper understanding of these models.
The following are the relevant artefacts for this project: -
1) Presentation slides: -        RNN-LSTM-Experiment-Presentation.pdf 
2) Video presentation: -         https://bit.ly/RNN-LSTM-Experiment-Demo
3) Jupyter Notebook: -           RNN_and_LSTM_Forgetfulness,_Exploding_and_Vanishing_Gradients.ipynb
